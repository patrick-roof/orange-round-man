# ORM E-commerce Back End

## Description

This backend application allows a user to seed a database with data, and add their own data for multiple products, tags, and categories. Using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests the user can select, create, update, and delete data in the database.

During this challenge I have learned a substantial amount of how to create routes, creating GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, as well as how to test them.
